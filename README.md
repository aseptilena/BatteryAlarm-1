# BatteryAlarm
A win32 application to monitor battery health between 40% - 80% and hence maximise battery life.

This is written in python2.7 and change the threshold percentages to change limits. 
I'll be enabling to set limit option in next releases.

Using #Beep Module to notify the user, but any other audio file can also be used.

Happy Coding!
